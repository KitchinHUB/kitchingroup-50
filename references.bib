                  soft and transferable pseudopotentials. Here we
                  present design criteria and testing results for a
                  new open-source "GBRV" ultrasoft pseudopotential
                  library that has been optimized for use in
                  high-throughput \{DFT\} calculations. We benchmark
                  the \{GBRV\} potentials, as well as two other
                  pseudopotential sets available in the literature, to
                  all-electron calculations in order to validate their

                  electrocatalytic properties of the resulting oxide

  abstract =	 "Based on an extensive set of density functional
                  theory calculations it is shown that for a class of
                  catalytic reactions there is a universal, reactant
                  independent relation between the reaction activation
                  energy and the stability of reaction
                  intermediates. This leads directly to a universal
                  relationship between adsorption energies and
                  catalytic activity, which is used to pinpoint what
                  it is that determines the best catalyst for a given
                  reaction. The universality principle rationalizes a
                  number of known facts about catalysts and points to
                  new ways of improving them. ",
